# Rail Guides

## Context

Rocket needs rail guides/buttons to slide on launch rail. Kit includes rail buttons.

## Current Setup

Kit-supplied rail buttons installed. Measure **6.2mm wide** at narrowest point.

## Concern

Unknown if kit buttons will fit the launch rail available in Sweden. Rail slot widths vary.

## Backup Plan

3D print rail guides from [same Thingiverse source](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6780161) as motor retainer. Will bring printed spares to Sweden.
