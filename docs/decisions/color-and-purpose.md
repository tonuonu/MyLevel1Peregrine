# Color and Purpose

## Decision

Blue rocket

## The Real Why

This rocket isn't just about L1 certification.

### Teaching Engineering to Children

From five children, two are underage daughters: **Liza (5)** and **Elsa (2)**. Teaching complicated topics to young children is difficult unless they're naturally interested.

### Sipsik Connection

In Estonia there's a beloved cartoon character **Sipsik** - a blue rag doll comfort toy belonging to a girl named Anu. Her older brother Mart builds a rocket from a cardboard box, and they throw it up hoping Sipsik will fly to the moon. In the cartoon, Sipsik actually reaches the moon and returns (probably only in Anu's dreams, but this detail doesn't matter to children).

This cartoon inspires Estonian girls to build rockets from cardboard boxes.

### The Opportunity

The moment exists now to teach the girls how we're *actually* going to send her Sipsik to the moon. A real rocket, real engineering, real flight - connected to something they already love and understand.

The blue color matches Sipsik's colors.

### Actual Sipsik Payload

Plan is to stuff a Sipsik toy into the rocket body for actual flight.

!!! warning "Open Problem"
    How to package Sipsik safely:
    
    - Protect from ejection charge heat/flames
    - Ensure recovery (not lost on ejection)
    - Not interfere with parachute deployment

## Outcome

The rocket serves dual purpose:

1. **Technical**: Tripoli L1 certification
2. **Educational**: Hands-on engineering lesson for daughters through familiar cultural connection
