# Why Sweden

## Context

Estonia has no Tripoli prefecture. Closest options are:

- Finland
- Latvia  
- Sweden

## Decision

Sweden - **Långtora Airfield**

- **Date**: Saturday, 24 January 2026
- **Backup**: Sunday, 25 January 2026 (weather contingency)

## Reasoning

1. **Personal** - Daughter lives in Stockholm
2. **Practical** - Discount coupons available for Tallink ferry
3. **Support** - Swedish Tripoli members confirmed they can sell motors locally

## Alternatives Considered

Finland and Latvia are geographically closer but lack the personal connections and confirmed motor availability.
