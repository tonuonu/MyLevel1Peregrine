# Motor Procurement

## Context

Need H-class motor for L1 certification attempt. Options:

1. Buy in Estonia, transport to Sweden
2. Buy locally in Sweden

## Decision

Purchase motor locally in Sweden (H128W + 38mm→29mm adapter from Swedish Tripoli members)

## Reasoning

### Estonian Regulatory Uncertainty

Estonia lacks clear framework for amateur rocketry:

- No Tripoli prefecture or members
- No established rocket launch sites
- Contacted **Lennuamet** (aviation authority) and **TTJA** (consumer protection/technical safety) - neither could provide clear guidance on pyrotechnics handling

### P2 Pyrotechnics Classification

H-class motors are P2 class pyrotechnics. Rules differ by country and TTJA couldn't confirm what certifications/tests would be required for legal purchase and possession.

### Border Transport Issues

Even if legally obtained in Estonia:

- Transporting pyrotechnics across borders requires paperwork
- Each country may have different rules
- Additional bureaucratic overhead for one-time use

### Ferry Transport Risk Assessment

Considered taking motor by car on Tallink ferry to Sweden:

- Would require one-time permission from Tallink
- From ferry operator's perspective: risk/reward doesn't make sense
- Small theoretical incident = millions in losses
- ~100 EUR ticket revenue not worth any risk
- Would likely be denied

### Swedish Solution

Contacted Swedish Tripoli members who confirmed:

- Can sell 1-2 H128W motors locally
- May have 38mm→29mm adapter available
- No border crossing with pyrotechnics needed
- Legal under Swedish framework

## Outcome

Motor will be purchased at or near launch site in Sweden. Eliminates all transport and regulatory complications.
