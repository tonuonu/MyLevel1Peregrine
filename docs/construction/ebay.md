# Electronics Bay Construction

## E-Bay Specifications

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Diameter | 98mm (4") |
| Design | Single threaded rod (lighter than dual) |
| Access | Wing nut removal, sled slides out |
| Sled | Glued to one bulkhead |

## Design Advantages

Apogee's e-bay design features:

- Fewer parts = lighter weight
- Faster field setup
- Shorter pre-flight checklist
- Easy electronics access

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Bulkhead Preparation

- Sand edges of plywood bulkheads
- Remove any laser char

### 2. Stop Rings

- Glue stop rings to inner tube
- These position the sled correctly

### 3. Threaded Rod Rails

- Glue alignment rails for threaded rod
- Ensures straight rod path

### 4. Sled Assembly

- Glue sled plate to bulkhead with single slot
- Add internal fillets for strength
- Pre-drill holes for altimeter mounting

### 5. Switch Band

- Install switch band on coupler tube
- May need to peel inner paper layer if tight fit
- Glue centered on coupler

### 6. Eyebolt Installation

- Install eyebolts on both bulkheads
- These attach to shock cords

### 7. Final Assembly

- Insert sled through coupler
- Secure with washer and wing nut
- Test fit in airframe

## Electronics Mounting

!!! note "Altimeter Installation"
    The sled provides mounting holes for:
    
    - Dual deployment altimeter
    - GPS tracker
    - Wiring routing between sides

### Recommended Altimeters

- Featherweight Blue Jay (compact, affordable)
- Missileworks RRC3
- Eggtimer Quantum
- PerfectFlite StratoLogger

## Wiring Considerations

- Route wires through sled holes
- Keep wiring short to reduce snag risk
- Use CAT5 cable for power runs
- Strategic hot glue to prevent vibration issues
