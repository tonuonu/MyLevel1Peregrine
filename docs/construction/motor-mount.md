# Motor Mount Construction

## Specifications

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Motor Tube ID | 38mm |
| Motor Tube Length | 11" (28 cm) |
| Centering Rings | Plywood, 38mm to 98mm |

## Motor Retention Options

The kit does NOT include motor retention. Options:

### Option 1: AeroPack Retainer (Recommended)

- AeroPack 38L for LOC-style paper tubes (OD 1.630")
- Provides professional appearance
- Easy motor changes
- Epoxy to aft centering ring

### Option 2: Fins & Fire Retainer

- Alternative to AeroPack
- Similar functionality

### Option 3: Masking Tape (Traditional)

- Wrap tape around motor at tube exit
- Simple and effective
- Must re-tape each flight

## Shock Cord Attachment

The motor mount includes a Kevlar cord anchor:

1. Thread Kevlar through centering ring holes
2. Secure with epoxy
3. Allows rear centering ring to be pulled out for internal fillet access

## Long Motor Accommodation

!!! note "Motor Length"
    The motor tube is 11" long. For motors longer than the tube:
    
    - Remove thrust block
    - Motor will project into parachute bay
    - Verify adequate space for recovery gear

## Build Notes

### Epoxy Selection

Used **1-hour epoxy** (working time) with **24-hour cure**.

!!! warning "Epoxy Viscosity Issue"
    The epoxy was quite liquid, which caused it to leak through small holes in the centering rings. This required careful orientation during curing.

### Curing Process

Due to liquid epoxy leaking, each side was cured separately:

1. **Day 1**: Motor mount positioned upright, epoxy applied to bottom centering ring area
2. **Day 2**: Flipped, epoxy applied to top centering ring area
3. **Day 3**: Internal fin fillets
4. **Day 4**: External fin fillets

Total cure time: ~4 days for complete assembly.

### Lessons Learned

- Thicker epoxy (Rocketpoxy or thickened with microballoons) would reduce leakage
- Pre-sealing centering ring holes with thin CA can help
- Patience with 24-hour cure cycles results in stronger bonds
