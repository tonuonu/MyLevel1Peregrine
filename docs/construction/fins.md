# Fin Construction

## Fin Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Quantity | 3 |
| Material | Birch plywood |
| Profile | Swept-back curved |
| Attachment | Through-the-wall (TTW) |
| Extends Below Tube | Yes |

## Unique Fin Design

The Peregrine's fins are distinctive:

- Curved leading edge (reminiscent of 1950s sci-fi rockets)
- Extend below the body tube base
- Interlocking tab structure for alignment
- Large surface area for stability

## Construction Steps

### 1. Preparation

- Sand fin edges lightly
- Test fit in body tube slots
- Ensure interlocking structure aligns properly

### 2. Tacking

- Use thick CA to tack fins in position
- Verify alignment with fin guide or laser level
- Check all fins are parallel to centerline

### 3. Internal Fillets

- Apply 30-minute epoxy inside motor mount area
- Use the Kevlar pull-out technique for rear ring access
- Ensure contact with motor tube and centering rings

### 4. External Fillets

- Mix Rocketpoxy or 30-minute epoxy
- Apply fillet material
- Use popsicle stick to form smooth concave shape
- Check for air bubbles at 15-minute mark
- Clean excess with fondant ball technique

## Fin Flutter Considerations

At expected velocities (under Mach 0.5), fin flutter is not a concern for:

- Birch plywood construction
- Proper fillet application
- Normal H/I motor flights
