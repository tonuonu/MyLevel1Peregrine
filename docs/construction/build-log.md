### 2025-12-XX: Motor Mount & Fin Assembly

**Duration:** ~4 days (24-hour epoxy cure cycles)

**Work completed:**

- Motor mount assembly with centering rings
- Through-the-wall (TTW) fin installation
- 6-point epoxy attachment for maximum strength

**Method:**

Used 1-hour working time epoxy with 24-hour cure. Due to liquid epoxy leaking through centering ring holes, each side was cured separately:

| Day | Work |
|-----|------|
| 1 | Bottom centering ring bonds |
| 2 | Top centering ring bonds |
| 3 | Internal fin fillets (to motor mount) |
| 4 | External fin fillets (to airframe) |

**Notes:**

The liquid epoxy was challenging - it kept seeping through small holes. Solution was to position the rocket so gravity kept epoxy at the joint being cured, then flip for opposite side. Result is very strong integrated fin can.

See [Motor Mount](motor-mount.md) and [Fins](fins.md) for detailed documentation.
