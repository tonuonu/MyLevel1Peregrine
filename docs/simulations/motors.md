# Motor Selection

## Kit Guidance

From kit packaging (IMG_7727):

- Requires **38mm diameter** rocket motors
- Use H, I or J power motors, as well as high thrust G motors

**Typical altitudes per packaging:**

| Motor Class | Altitude Range |
|-------------|----------------|
| G motors | 300-500 ft (requires avg thrust ≥80N) |
| H motors | 600-1700 ft |
| I motors | 1700-3500 ft |
| J motors | 3700-6100 ft |

## Selected Motor

**AeroTech H128W-14A** - purchased locally in Sweden from Tripoli members.

See [Motor Procurement](../decisions/motor-procurement.md) for why this is the only practical option.

### Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Diameter | 29mm (reload) |
| Total Impulse | 172.9 N·s |
| Max Thrust | 168.7 N |
| Average Thrust | 128 N |
| Burn Time | 1.3 s |
| Delay | 14 s (adjustable) |
| Propellant | White Lightning (W) |
| Motor Length | 194 mm |
| Total Mass | 215 g |
| Propellant Mass | 93.6 g |

### Hardware Required

The H128W is a reload motor requiring:

- AeroTech 29/180 Case (PN: 60010)
- 29mm forward closure
- 29mm aft closure

### Adapter Required

Peregrine has 38mm motor mount. H128W is 29mm.

Requires **38mm to 29mm adapter** - available from Swedish club members.

## Safety

Based on [AeroTech Safety Data Sheet](Aerotech_Motors_SDS.pdf):

### Hazard Classification

H128W propellant mass is 93.6g, classified as **Explosive 1.3C** (>62.5g propellant).

### Handling

- No smoking within 25 ft (7.6m)
- Keep away from open flames and heat sources
- Store in dry location, away from acids
- Keep in original packaging until ready for use
- Do not use indoors

### Combustion Products

White Lightning propellant produces:

- Hydrogen Chloride (HCl)
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)

Do not breathe exhaust fumes.

### Physical Properties

- Auto-ignition temperature: 550°F (288°C)
- Propellant density: 0.058-0.065 lb/in³

### First Aid

- **Inhalation**: Move to fresh air, call physician if symptoms persist
- **Skin contact**: Wash immediately
- **Burns**: Immerse in cold water, seek medical attention for severe burns
- **Ingestion**: Induce vomiting, call physician

### Fire Fighting

Use water only. Foam and CO2 are ineffective. Motors may become propulsive in fire.

### Disposal

Do not dispose in landfill or sewer. Burn in controlled manner: bury motor with only nozzle exposed, ignite electrically from safe distance.

## EU P2 Pyrotechnics Regulation

H-class motors are **P2 category** under EU Directive 2013/29/EU.

Per TTJA (Estonian Technical Regulatory Authority): Each EU member state determines P2 handling rules internally. In Estonia, the equipment producer should provide adequate training, which forms the basis for professional P2 device handling.

!!! question "Training Adequacy"
    Whether reading the AeroTech SDS constitutes adequate "producer training" for Estonian P2 compliance is unclear. This is one reason for [flying in Sweden](../decisions/why-sweden.md) where the regulatory framework is established.

Apogee product page lists compatible motors: [Peregrine on Apogee Rockets](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket-Kits/Skill-Level-3-Model-Rocket-Kits/Peregrine)

*Note: Most motors listed there are not available for purchase in Estonia/Europe. The H128W was selected based on what Swedish Tripoli members can provide locally.*
