    - Discusses caliber vs percentage stability display in OpenRocket
    - **Contains Peregrine.ork file** shared by user
    - Explains apparent CP/CG calculation discrepancies are due to OpenRocket rounding display values
    - Actual values: diameter 10.16cm (not 10.2cm), CG 113.79cm, CP 130.25cm

!!! note "OpenRocket Rounding"
    OpenRocket displays rounded values but calculates with full precision. This explains why manual calculations from displayed values may not match the stability shown.
